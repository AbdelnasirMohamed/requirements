\section{OpenETCS case study}

\todo{This section is intentionnally empty for the moment : }

\todo{it will be completed when the document provided by Alstom on API  will be available.}

\subsection{Aim of the OpenETCS project}

\begin{comment} 
The goal of The OpenETCS project is to provide a formal model of the On board Unit from the Subset 26 specification.

The following sections are going to give a high level description of this case study and expected elements.

Detailled specification of the system will be given during WP3 activities.

\subsection{High level description of the  case study}
high level description of the subset + link to reference documentation (subset 26)


\req{The model shall comply all OBU ETCS mandatory requirements for level upto 2, in the 
functional perimeter provided by the Functional Architecture.}
\subreq{The model shall comply the OBU part of SUBSET-26-3.3.0.}



\subreq{The reference ETCS baseline shall be modified only by project decision, according
to the QA Plan.}
\subreq{All divergences against the chosen baseline shall be documented and tracked, according
to the QA Plan.}

\subsection{Environement and abstract architecture}

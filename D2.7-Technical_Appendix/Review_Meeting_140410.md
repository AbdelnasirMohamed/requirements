1. Introduction (Baseliyos)  
Alstom openETCS API is starting point for openETCS Developement.
The API has to be designed in a way that it is generic to work with other Hardware. 
The API has to be future-proof.
The API is currently used by Baseline 3 Alstom developement of Onboard Platform.
 
GE started a SysML model on the API as a part of WP5 activities. Exchange of the information will be organised in a meeting (Bernd to organise)

Conditions: to be discussed with new WP3 lead ()
 WP3 will model the API in SysML (accepted under condition)

Commercial Requirements: openETCS API is planned to be used in future tenders in the railway sector.
Discussion on "Stability of the interfaces".
Target: it has to upward compatible.
Example: odometry information is part of the Balise interface in the current implementation. The example shows dependency on the chosen soltuion. 

Additional Requirements: the openETCS API has to be open for other products. (Check wording)

Hardware and Communication Channels slide:
Alstom has reasons to have both types of interfaces (telegrams with e.g., JRU and DMI, Variables in Odometry).
Conclusion: ?

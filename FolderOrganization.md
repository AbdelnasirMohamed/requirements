The folders should be organized the following way in the requirement repository

* Requirements : main requirement repository
    * D2.1 --- State of the art : report on existing methodologies 
    * D2.2 --- State of the art : report on CENELEC 
    * D2.3 --- Definition of the overall process for the formal description of ETCS and the rail system it works on
    * D2.4 --- Definition of the methods used to perform the formal description
    * D2.5 --- Methods and tools benchmarking methodology
    * D2.6 --- Set of requirements for the model used and the modeling process
    * D2.7 --- Set of requirements for the API
    * D2.8 --- Set of requirements for the tools used
    * D2.9 --- Set of requirements for the V&V process
    * MinutesOfMeetings : Self explanatory
    * Workspace : All temporary documentation that does not fit anywhere
    * Tools : Self explanatory
    * Reference : Delivered reference versions of documents
       * D2.1 --- State of the art : report on existing methodologies 
       * D2.2 --- State of the art : report on CENELEC 
       * D2.3 --- Definition of the overall process for the formal description of ETCS and the rail system it works on
       * D2.4 --- Definition of the methods used to perform the formal description
       * D2.5 --- Methods and tools benchmarking methodology
       * D2.6 --- Set of requirements for the model used and the modeling process
       * D2.7 --- Set of requirements for the API
       * D2.8 --- Set of requirements for the tools used
       * D2.9 --- Set of requirements for the V&V process


The documents in progress should be found in Requirements/D2.x. After approval, the approved version is copied in the
Reference subtree. In this reference subtree, the subfolders will follow this pattern:
   * Reference :
      * D2.x : xxx
         * 01-00
            * doc.tex
            * doc.pdf
            * doc.xxx
            * Review Sheet D2.x 01-00.xls
         * V02/00
            * doc.tex
            * doc.pdf
            * doc.xxx
            * Review Sheet D2.x 02-00.xls

\subsection{Introduction to SysML with Papyrus}

\begin{comment}
short introduction to sysML language with references to  OMg specification and major document which describe it + short description of main concepts of SysML +  short description of particularities of SysML on papyrus. (parts of 07.1.3\_O7.1.7 may be reused). 
\end{comment}

\subsection{SysML in the project}

\begin{comment}
for high level modelling to complete.

First ideas 

  \begin{itemize}
  	\item SSRS:  
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item functional architecture (organic architecture)
  		\item logical interfaces 
  		\item requirements: Todo but may be completed with other tools as ProR)
  		\item data dictionary (how to access a common data repository)
  		\item sequence of functions ?
  		\item need to declare specific domain objects (switch, signals,...) ?
	\end{itemize} 
	\item API: 
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item logical interface 
  		\item sequence of functions ?
  		\item implementation requirements
	\end{itemize}  	
	\item Sub-system semi-formal definition
	  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item sequence of functions 
  		\item activities
  		\item state machine
	\end{itemize}  	
    \item Safety: 
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item Functional Breakdown Structure (common with SSRS)
  		\item profile for safety
	\end{itemize}  	
    \item VnV : test case

  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Selection of used diagrams}

SysML diagrams that can be used for modeling are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Package Diagram}: Structure description
\item \emph{Block Definition Diagram} (BDD): Structure description
\item \emph{Internal Block Diagram} (IBD): Structure description
\item \emph{Sequence Diagram}: Test case, execution trace, counter
  example, etc.
\item \emph{State Machine Diagram}: Behaviour description
\item \emph{Requirement Diagram}: Requirements description
\end{itemize}

The following other SysML diagrams \emph{cannot} be used:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Parametric Diagram}
\item \emph{Activity Diagram}
\item \emph{Use Case Diagram}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Remarks for all diagrams}

Following elements are allowed on all kinds of diagrams:
\begin{itemize}
\item Comment Note
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Notes on selected diagrams}

The diagrams and diagram elements of SysML have been chosen because
(1) they are supported by Papyrus v0.10.0 used in Eclipse Kepler
release and because (2) they are the minimal subset of SysML needed
for a proper system description and V\&V activities.

In the future, we can decide to augment the chosen SysML subset
because Papyrus offers new capabilities and because new elements are
needed. This can been done at project level following a procedure
which is not yet decided.

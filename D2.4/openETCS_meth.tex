According to  the WP7 decision meeting, the 4th of July, in Paris, SysML, supported by the Papyrus tool,  has been chosen to  cover the highest level of modelling.

The choice of the approaches for the lower levels of modelling is not yet fixed.

This section gives a proposal on how to use the selected approaches to produce from the input documents (ERA documentation and complements)  to a SIL4 code.

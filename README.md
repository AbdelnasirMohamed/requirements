WP2 - Requirements
==================
Work Package 2 Top Level Project

Hot Topics:
===========
* We have the API Requirements Review currently in progress.  
* 2 review sessions have been conducted. You find the results here:
 * [12.04.2014](https://github.com/openETCS/requirements/tree/master/D2.7-Technical_Appendix/2014-04-12-Munich-Meeting)
 * [13.05.2014](https://github.com/openETCS/requirements/tree/master/D2.7-Technical_Appendix/2014-05-13-Munich-Meeting)
* A new document has been started to concentrate on the [API Requirements](https://github.com/openETCS/requirements/blob/master/D2.7-Technical_Appendix/2014-05-13-Munich-Meeting/Bullit%20point%20openETCS%20requirements_20140511.pdf) from a user point of view. Idea is to have a document which is useable for contract negotiations.
 The revision of the document is started.
* There is still an open issue to make the location of the Alstom API Document clear.
